## Lab 1

### Learning Outcomes
- Become familiar with the syntax of Processing
- Become familiar with writing and running sketches in Processing
- Practice using variables
- Practice using loops
- Practice using nested loops and the if statement

Take the time to look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size

Here are two shapes you can draw:

Try experimenting with colours!

Now try and figure out how to these patterns:

![Sketch](images/p2.png)

(Use variables as much as possible and use a loop in your solution)

Now try this one:

Finally try this one:

Notice the mouths

Feel free to experiment with colour!
